        <h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>The Web Technology Group is a collaboration between students and faculty/staff at Union College who are interested in web design and web development. This group includes students in both the computing and graphic design programs, as well as computing faculty and staff in information technology.</p>

<p><strong>The goal of this collaboration is to make awesome stuff and have fun doing it.</strong></p>

<h3>What's Going On</h3>

<p>We are in the early days of this collaboration, but we are sharing resources and ideas on <a href="https://github.com/unioncollege-webtechnology/unioncollege-webtechnology.github.io/wiki">the wiki</a> and asking questions and getting feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/unioncollege-webtechnology/unioncollege-webtechnology.github.io/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h3>Get Involved</h3>

<p>If you are a student or faculty/staff member at Union College and would like to get involved, contact Gary Dickerson (<a href="https://github.com/gadicker">@gadicker</a>) or Ben Barber (<a href="https://github.com/barberboy">@barberboy</a>) and we'll add you to the Github organization (once you <a href="https://github.com/edu">have a Github account</a>).</p>

<p>If you are a web professional and interested in collaborating/mentoring, we'd love for you to participate as well. Contribute code, join the discussion, add to the wiki; or send an email to Gary or Ben and we'll find a way for you to be more involved.</p>

<h3>Thanks!</h3>
